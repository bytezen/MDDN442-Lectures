title: Geometric Algebra Group
content-class: smaller


Geometric Algebra is an alternative framework to Linear Algebra (though more generalized) for working with geometry (shapes in space). It has applications in computer graphics, physics, and is also beautiful math.

If this sounds interesting, check out the first chapter of the book which gives a great high-level overview, [Geometric Algebra Overview](http://www.geometricalgebra.net/downloads/ga4cs_chapter1.pdf)

The idea for the group is to read a chapter every other week and meet to discuss and go over the exercises. Let me know if you're interested and we can work out the logistics :)
