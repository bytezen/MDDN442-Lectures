## Background
Here you can find Lecture notes for MDDN 442. This trimeseter I am experimenting with a new slide workflow.
You can witness the spectacular failings, triumphs and evolution of the process by cloning this repo.

This code project is based on Google's Google IO project documented [here](https://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/)

## Usage

_As of version 1.1 (06 Mar 2013) the build process for the slides is not automated and requires manual operation. As a result I will not document how to build the slides from the markdown source. If you are interested in learning how to do that we can discuss it in class or privately._

In the 'Lectures/html' open the lecture##.html file in Chrome. That's it. Here is a [short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=WRvECXyWj80) from the original Google Project.

As I customize the render script and CSS for the course I will be publishing the changes here.
